This exercise tells me that I have to write first a procedure that computes a function f with a recursive process:

f is defined by
if n < 3; f(n) = n
if n >= 3; f(n) = f (n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3)

the most straightforward approach will generate first a tree recursive procedure



(define (f n) (if (< n 3) n (+ 
								(f (- n 1))
								(* 2 (f (- n 2)))
								(* 3 (f (- n 3)))
							)
				)
)
