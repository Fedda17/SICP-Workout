To complete this exercise, I have to verify if these procedures are a valid representation of a pair and use the substitution model as a test:

(define (cons x y) 
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))

(define (car z) 
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))

TEST RESULT --- 

> (car (cons 1 2)) 
1
> (car (cons '() 2))
'()
> (car (cons (lambda (x) x) 2))
#<procedure>
> (car (cons (lambda (x) x) 'ciao))
#<procedure>
> 

OK

Now what about the cdr procedure?

(define (cdr z) 
  (z (lambda (p q) q)))

Seemed enough evident that this is the definition considering the car procedure.

Now I'll use the substitution model to see how the process works:
