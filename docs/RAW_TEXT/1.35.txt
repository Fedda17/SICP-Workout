This exercise requires me to find φ using the fixed point procedure that the text put together, I'm gonna fish it again:

(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) 
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
  
The transformation that I need to apply is: x ↦ 1 + 1 / x

(define (phi x) 
		(fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1.0) 

The number I receive is 1.6180327868852458, that is an approximation of the golden ratio.
