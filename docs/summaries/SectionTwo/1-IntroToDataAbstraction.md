# 2.1 Intro to Data Abstraction

## 2.1
### Description
Polish make-rat in order to get an accurate sign for the representaton of the rational number
### Resolution
A detail I didn't consider in Scheme until now, so I had trouble putting the procedure in the right steps. Also the book talks about using these kind of operations when data is accessed but I decided them to put into the constructor.

## 2.2
### Description
Building an abstraction for segment using points and implement the mid-point
### Resolution
This was my first attempt at building an abstract data in Scheme and it was fun to see how the pieces stuck together. A mistake in the representation by exposing a more primitive data type.

## 2.3
### Description
Building a further abstraction "rectangle" from segments and something else
### Resolution
A higher view abstraction level to which was fun adding my perspective on it. Also, yet another mistake on how to represent the data.

## 2.5
### Description
Building a new representation for couples that works only for positive numbers
### Resolution
A different angle on this aspect of a language that was useful to unlock how to see unconventional ways to build a compost data

## 2.6
### Description
The Church's Numbers are numbers that have as a aggregation mechanism the number to which a procedure f is applied, so I had to invent a way to operate on them using lambda
### Resolution
A bit tedious exercise that required lots of tries and retracing with the substitution model. I guess it was another way for the book to make me see how the barrier between procedure and data is destroyed.

## 2.7-2.16 (Incomplete)
### Description
Lab exercise that required to build an abstraction in order to work with parallel transistors with a program.
### Resolution
I skipped most of these exercises because I couldn't find worthwhile knowledge to pursue into them, and I was a bit confounded by the requirements as well (if you know a way to approach constructively these exercises let me know)
