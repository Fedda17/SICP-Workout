# 2.2 Hiercarchical Data and the closure property

## 2.17
### Description
Take the last pair of a list
### Resolution
My first attempt at manipulating a list and made me explore how a list is formally built and familiarize with it.

## 2.18
### Description
Reverse a List
### Resolution
A more comples exercise for manipulating a list, the cdr convention was a struggle to shed light into, but I managed to find a bit contrivied alternate route using primitive procedures that represent a list to solve the exercise.

## 2.19
### Description
The coin change program but with a data abstraction for the type of coins
### Resolution
A bit of exercise for manipulating data and taking its part for a well known problem in the book

## 2.20
### Description
A procedure that takes an arbitrary number of arguments and returns a list of elements which satisfy the criteria same parity of the first argument
### Resolution
I never heard of the dotted-tail notation and calling a procedure with this style was a bit troublesome for me, also it's cool to know there's a convention in Lisp that makes me do that, though I guess I can always use lists as arguments.

## 2.21
### Description
Simple substitution exercise: putting the piece together for writing a procedure that square elements of a list
### Resolution
A primitive intro to map operations I guess.

## 2.22
### Description
Explanation for some misunderstanding on lists operation in the procedures provided by the text
### Resolution
How recursion builds a list?

## 2.23
### Description
Write a for-each procedure in Scheme
### Resolution
I used map as a template and then made use of the fact that with cond I can write multiple combination in a condition.

## Barkeley Exercises
### Resolution
More hands on list operations, but the new specification for the Church's number at the end was brutal. Composing a procedure using lambda specified by symbols was a welcome experiment.
