This exercise asks me to define a procedure which:

domain: list
range: pair

the range is the last pair of the sequence. The procedure name is last-pair.
``` racket
(define (last-pair l)
    (if (null? l) (car l) (last-pair (cdr l))))
```

TEST RESULT -- NEGATIVE  
car: contract violation  
  expected: pair?  
  given: '()  
> I was expecting this one because it was obvious that I can't perform car if the list is null.

``` racket
(define (last-pair l)
    (if (null? (cdr l)) (car l) (last-pair (cdr l))))
```


TEST RESULT --- POSITIVE!

> (last-pair (list 23 7 149 34))  
34  
> (last-pair (list 23 7 149))  
149
