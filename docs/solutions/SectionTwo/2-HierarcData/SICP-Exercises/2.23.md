## Follow Up
this exercise asks me to implement a for-each procedure 
hint: map over a list.

the procedure for-each manipulates a list in order to get an arbitrary value.
the procedure for-each performs an action to each element of a list.

## Implementation
``` racket
(define (for-each action l)
    (cond   ((null? l) (error "no elements provided"))
            ((null? (cdr l) ) (action (car l)))
            (else 
                (action (car l))
                (for-each action (cdr l)))
    )

)
```

TEST RESULT --- POSITIVE
