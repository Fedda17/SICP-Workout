This exercise asks me to implement selectors for the resistor in order to make them work in Alyssas's interval arithmetic procedure.
A constructor is already defined:  
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))  

According to the interval definition, then I can extract the endpoints using these two procedures:

(define (upper-bound c) (car c))  
(define (lower-bound c) (cdr c))
