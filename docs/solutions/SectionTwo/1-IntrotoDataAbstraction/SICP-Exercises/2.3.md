## Follow Up
This exercise asks me to implement two different modules of representation of a rectangle and test the two implementations with a perimeter and area procedure.
Also suggests me to use the segment procedures I defined in the previous exercise:

``` racket

(define (make-point x y) (if (and (number? x) (number? y)) (cons x y) (error "required numbers for point")))
(define (x-point point) (car point))
(define (y-point point) (cdr point))

(define (make-segment p1 p2) 
    (define (is-point? p) (and (number? (car p)) (number? (cdr p))))
(if (and (is-point? p1) (is-point? p2)) (cons p1 p2) (error "required points for segments.")))
(define (start-segment seg) (car seg))
(define (end-segment seg) (cdr seg))

(define (get-segment-length seg) 
    (let ((pythagora (lambda (c1 c2)
          (sqrt (+ (square (- (x-point c1) (x-point c2)))
                (square (- (y-point c1) (y-point c2)))))))
        )
    (pythagora (start-segment seg) (end-segment seg)))
)
```

## A bit of cleanup
redefinition of make-segment procedure in order to use it as a check for correct construction of a segment.

``` racket
(define (make-segment p1 p2) 
    (define (is-point? p) (and (number? (car p)) (number? (cdr p))))
(if (and (is-point? p1) (is-point? p2)) (cons p1 p2) '()))
```

## First implementation of abstracting a rectangle
Now for the rectangle module:

``` racket
(define (make-rect late1 late2)
        (define (is-segment? seg) (if (equal? (make-segment (car seg) (cdr seg)) '()) #f #t))
        (if (and (is-segment? late1) (is-segment? late2)) (cons late1 late2) '()))

(define (get-first-late rect)
         (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect")
          (car rect)))
(define (get-second-late rect) (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect") 
            (cdr rect)))



(define (perimeter-of-rect rect) 
    (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) 
        (error "not a rect")
        (* 2 (+ (car rect) (cdr rect))))
)

(define (area-of-a-rect rect) 
    (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) 
            (error "not a rect")
            (* (car rect) (cdr rect))
    )
)
```
### First Cleanup of the abstraction
I'll have to remake the last two because I don't like how it exposes car and cdr to the definitions that use the abstract data directly

``` racket
(define (perimeter-of-rect rect) 
        (* 2 (+ (get-first-late rect) (get-second-late rect)))
)

(define (area-of-a-rect rect) 
            (* (get-first-late rect) (get-second-late rect))
)
```


TEST RESULT --- NEGATIVE: 
 +: contract violation  
  expected: number?  
  given: '((1 . 3) 5 . 7)

### Second cleanup of the abstraction
I have to modify the late procedure in order to make them return a number when called so we can perform the calculations for area and perimeter:

``` racket
(define (get-first-late rect)
         (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect")
          (get-segment-length (car rect))))
(define (get-second-late rect) (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect") 
            (get-segment-length (cdr rect))))
```
problem: it exposes car and cdr.

I defined a get-segment-length procedure that uses the pythagorean theorem

TEST RESULT --- POSITIVE

> (perimeter-of-rect rect-1)  
36.92620544871615

(area-of-a-rect rect-1)  
72.44308110509934


## Second Implementation of abstracting a rectangle
For a different implementation of a rectangle, I can consider it being formed by two datas: the length of late a and the length of late b:

``` racket
(define (make-rect late-a late-b) (if (and (number? late-a) (number? late-b)) (cons late-a late-b) '()))
(define (get-first-late rect) (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect") (car rect)))
(define (get-second-late rect) (if (empty? (make-rect (car rect) (cdr rect))) (error "not a rect") (cdr rect)))
```

TEST RESULT --- POSITIVE

>  (perimeter-of-rect (make-rect 13 17))  
60  
>  (area-of-a-rect (make-rect 13 17))  
221  
> 

This concludes the exercise
