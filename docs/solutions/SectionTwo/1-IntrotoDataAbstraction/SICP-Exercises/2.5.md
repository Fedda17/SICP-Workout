This exercise asks me to implement a pair of only non negative numbers a and b as the product of 2^a*3^b

So this number makes the pair (a, b)

if (cons a b) = 2^a*3^b for a, b > 0
then (car c) = a 
and (cdr c) = b

``` racket

(define (cons a b)
    (* (expt 2 a) (expt 3 b)))

(define (car c)
    (+ 1 (if (= 0 (remainder c 2))  (car (/ c 2)) 0))

(define (cdr c)
    (+ 1 (if (= 0 (remainder c 3)) (cdr (/ c 3)) 0))
``` racket

So by using these procedures, I think I'll obtain the expt of 2 and 3 that are a and b

RESULT TEST --- NEGATIVE

> (define c (cons 5 4))
> (car c)
6

the way the recursion worked it increased before it was necessary.

CORRECT PROCEDURES:
``` racket
(define (car c)
    (if (= 0 (remainder c 2)) (+ 1 (car (/ c 2))) 0))

(define (cdr c)
    (if (= 0 (remainder c 3)) (+ 1 (cdr (/ c 3))) 0))
```

TEST RESULT -- POSITIVE:
> (cdr (cons 5 4))
4
> (car (cons 5 4))
5
>
