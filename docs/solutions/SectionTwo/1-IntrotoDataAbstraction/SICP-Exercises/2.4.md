## Follow Up
To complete this exercise, I have to verify if these procedures are a valid representation of a pair and use the substitution model as a test:

## Verification of the constructors and selectors
``` racket
(define (cons x y) 
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))

(define (car z) 
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))
```

TEST RESULT --- 

> (car (cons 1 2))  
1  
> (car (cons '() 2))  
'()  
> (car (cons (lambda (x) x) 2))  
#<procedure>  
> (car (cons (lambda (x) x) 'ciao))  
#<procedure>  
>  

OK

## New definition for cdr of a couple
Now what about the cdr procedure?

``` racket
(define (cdr z) 
  (z (lambda (p q) q)))
```

Seemed enough evident that this is the definition considering the car procedure.

## Test using the substitution model
Now I'll use the substitution model to see how the process works:

FOR CONS
(cons 1 2)  
->(lambda (m) (m 1 2))  
    return procedure above  
    (the strength of the cons procedure defined by the language is that it returns as a value the pair)  

suppose the pair above is t:

FOR CAR
(car m)  
->(t (lambda (p q) p))  
-> ((lambda (m) (m 1 2)) (lambda (p q) p))  
-> ((lambda (p q) p) 1 2) -> (lambda (1 2) 1)    according to the substition model.  

cdr is similar.
