# 2.12
Exercise for different constructors and selectors for intervals.

constructor make-center-percent:
two inputs: the center and a percentage
output: the interval

selector percent:
input: interval
output: percentage tolerance


center selector:
``` racket
(define (center i)
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) 
        (upper-bound i)) 
     2))

(define (width i)
  (/ (- (upper-bound i) 
        (lower-bound i)) 
     2))
```

## First Attempt
different constructor for interval:
``` racket
(define (make-center-width c w)
  (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w)))
(define (make-center-percent c p)
    (let ((ratio-of-center ( * (/ c 100) p)))     
        (make-interval (- p ratio-of-center) (+ p ratio-of-center))))

(define (percent i)
    (* 100 (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i))))
```
