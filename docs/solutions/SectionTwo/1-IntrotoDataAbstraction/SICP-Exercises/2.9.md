This exercise asks me to make a function for showing that the width of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added.

They define width of an interval as half of the difference between its upper and lower bound.

I think I have to show if width(int1+int2) is correct as width(int1) + width(int2)


``` racket
(define (width x)
    (/ (- (upper-bound x) (lower-bound x)) 2)
)
```

to show that width(int1) + width(int2) is correct I'll use width(int1) - width(int1) = width(int1+int2) = 0
Instead, width(int1/int1) != 1

TEST RESULT ---

> (- (width (make-interval 2.45 2.89)) (width (make-interval 2.45 2.89)))  
0.0  
> (width (sub-interval (make-interval 2.45 2.89) (make-interval 2.45 2.89) ))  
0.0  
> (width (div-interval (make-interval 2.45 2.89) (make-interval 2.45 2.89) ))  
-0.16592048584139535  
>  (/ (width (make-interval 2.45 2.89)) (width (make-interval 2.45 2.89)))  
1.0  
> 

This concludes the exercise
