## Follow Up
This exercise requires to modify the mul-interval definition in order to consider the sign of the endpoints interval according to nine cases:

## First Attempt
``` racket
(define (mul-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x) 
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p2 (* (lower-bound x) 
               (upper-bound y)))
        (p3 (* (upper-bound x) 
               (lower-bound y)))
        (p4 (* (upper-bound x) 
               (upper-bound y))))
    (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4)
                   (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))
```

How do I test the signs of an endpoint's interval?
there's the primitive procedure positive?

How do I break the mul-interval according to the sign of the endpoint?


Try again after end section 2?
