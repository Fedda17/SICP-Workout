## Follow Up
I have to modify the code of div-interval because we don't have a rule for dividing an interval that spans 0:

## Implementation
``` racket
(define (div-interval x y)
  (mul-interval x 
                (if (or (= (upper-bound y) 0.0) (= (lower-bound y) 0.0))
                        (error "not clear when divisor spans 0")
                        (make-interval 
                            (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y)) 
                            (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))))
```
