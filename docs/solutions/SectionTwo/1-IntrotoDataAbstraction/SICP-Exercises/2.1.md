Make-rat procedure version that handle the sign of the rational in this way:
if the rational is positive if both num and den are > 0
otherwise, the numerator is negative.

importing the definitions for make-rate, num and denom

``` racket
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons (/ (if (> (* n d) 0) n (- n) g) 
          (/ (abs d) g))))

(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))

(define (print-rat x)
  (newline)
  (display (numer x))
  (display "/")
  (display (denom x)))

    (define (numer x) (car x))
    (define (denom x) (cdr x))
```

--- TEST RESULT
> (make-rat -5 -3)  
'(5 . 3)  
> (make-rat 5 -2)  
'(5 . -2)  

I forgot to make the denominator always positive, now by using the abs function I adjusted the behaviour


--- TEST RESULT
> (make-rat 1 -2)  
'(-1 . 2)  
> (make-rat 6 -3)  
'(2 . -1)  

Since gcd operates on n and d, I guess it's significant for the signs of the numbers. I have to make a combination that modify the sign before:

``` racket
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons ((if (> (* n d) 0) + - ) (/ n g)) 
          (abs (/ d g)))))
```

--- TEST RESULT
 (make-rat 6 -3)  
'(2 . 1)  

The test is still negative, I use abs in the gcd reduction because the sign doesn't affect it and I need to consider only positive numbers:

``` racket
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (abs (gcd n d))))
    (cons ((if (> (* n d) 0) + - ) (/ (abs n) g)) 
          (abs (/  d g)))))
```

> (make-rat 6 -3)  
'(-2 . 1)  
> (make-rat -6 3)  
'(-2 . 1)  
> (make-rat -1 2)  
'(-1 . 2)  
> (make-rat 10 5)  
'(2 . 1)  

now the procedure works.
