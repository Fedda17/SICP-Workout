This exercise asks me to implement a sub-interval procedure for interval arithmetic for resistors following 
the thought process provided by the text.

``` racket
(define (sub-interval x y)
    (add-interval x 
                (make-interval (- (upper-bound y))
                                (- (lower-bound y))
                )
    )
)
```

"The inverse of the add-interval procedure".
