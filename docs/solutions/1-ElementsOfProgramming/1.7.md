# 1.7
[1.7]: 
Exercise 1.7 assumes that the good-enough procedure? defined with:

``` racket
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
```

## Breakthrough
It is not suitable for large and small numbers due to the computer's limited ability to accurately express mathematical operations. He then invites me to do some tests using the procedure and draw conclusions. Doing tests with the good-enough procedure, it seems to me that it is infallible with large numbers, I tried up to about 10^50, but it seems to me that the problem arises when the test has to compose a block to draw numbers iteratively closer to the value that the procedure wants, which is why the exercise tells me to approximate with the awareness that computers take shortcuts to escape perfection, because it would require an infinite process. So he suggests that I alter the good-enough procedure so that it can say that the approximation is sufficient to obtain the square root of a large number. It suggests using a tolerance that corresponds to (- very small fraction + guess) < (improve guess x) < (very small fraction + guess)
 
 
Then applying this new hypothesis to the good-enough procedure I change it to:
``` racket
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs  (- (improve  guess x) guess))   0.0000000001))
```

In short, the "tolerance" that this new function uses is calibrated around how much the guess variation becomes sufficiently insignificant by proceeding with the iteration
  
  
## Definitions that helped

``` racket
(define (improve x y)  (average x (/ y x)))

(define (average x y) 
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
  
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
```


 Correctness test for good-enough:
``` racket
  (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```
