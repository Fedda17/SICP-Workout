``` racket
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
``` 
First the interpreter resolves the most nested expression which is if...
It returns + or - replacing them with an expression containing machine instructions for the operation, then the operands are applied to the operation.
Then it assigns the expression via a define to the symbol (a-plus-abs-b to b) and returns nothing because define is a special form.
