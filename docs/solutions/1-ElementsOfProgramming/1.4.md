``` racket
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
``` 
First the interpreter resolves the most nested expression which is if...
It returns + or - without calculating them (it will do so in the next iteration), after which it remains (+/- a b) and becomes a combination with only primitive expressions that have value in the environment
Then it assigns the expression via a define to the symbol (a-plus-abs-b to b) and returns nothing because define is a special form.
