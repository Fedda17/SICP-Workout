# 1.3

The problem consists of:  
1. Find the largest number and make it square  
2. Find the second largest number and make it square  
3. Add them and assign the procedure to a definition  


## First Attempt
How do I find the two largest numbers?

I think it is simpler to find the smallest number, consequently the other 2 are larger, so as to also cover any equality between numbers, since a, b, c are not necessarily different.

Then finding the smallest number becomes a case of the no-largest number among a, b, and c:
``` racket
(cond ((not (> c a)) (a))
  ((not (> c b)) (b))
  (else c))
``` 
--- Testing the procedure  
Negative outcome.

If 3 <= 1 return 1  
If 3 <= 2 return 2  
Otherwise 3 X  

(1, 2, 3)

There was a reasoning error: The non-largest number is not the smallest one. Furthermore, the procedure formulated does not have the outcome I expected due to the lack of effort of the operators.

## Second Attempt
To make it easier for me to manage the expression: 
``` racket
(define (>= a b) (not (< a b)))
``` 

Now since I have to find the right sequence in each case, to make my life even easier: 
``` racket
(define (cresc-eq-seq a b c) (and (>= a b) (>= b c)))
``` 
Now comparing a, b, c I find the two numbers that are no longer smaller, square them and add them.
``` racket
(define (f a b c) (cond ((cresc-eq-seq a b c) (+ (square b) (square c)))
 ((cresc-eq-seq c b a) (+ (square b) (square a)))
 (else (+ (square a) (square c)))))
```

Since the environment does not have the square procedure: (define (square x) (* x x))

--- Testing the procedure  
Negative result.

 If 1 >= 2 >= 3 return 2^2 + 3^3  
 If 3 >= 2 >= 1 return 2^2 + 1^1  
(1, 2, 3)

 There was a reasoning error: I used the >= sign, furthermore this procedure forces me to check all the permutations between a, b and c. I have to retrace my steps...

## Breakthrough
How do I get the two largest numbers?
If I follow the reasoning of finding the smallest

 This procedure gets the smallest
 ``` racket
 (define (f a b c) (if (<= a c) a (if (<= b c) b c)))
 ``` 

How do I get the rest? I cannot. So all I have to do is choose the two procedurally greatest.

 So if a >= b I take a, if c >= b I take c
``` racket
 (define (f a b c) (cond ((>= a b) (+ (square a) (square (cond ((>= c b) c)
 (else b)))))
 (else (+ (square b) (square (cond ((>= c a) c) (else a)))))))
```
--- Testing the procedure  
 Successful.  
 If 1 >= 2 we return the square of 2 which we add to the square of the next largest number which is:  
 If 2 >= 3 return the square of 3 vvv  

 (1,2,3)

## Definitions that helped
``` racket
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (<= a b) (not (> a b)))
(define (cresc-eq-seq a b c) (and (>= a b) (>= b c)))
(define (f a b c) (cond ((>= a b) (+ (square a) (square (cond ((>= c b) c)
                                               (else b)))))
                          (else (+ (square b) (square (cond ((>= c a) c) (else a)))))))
```
