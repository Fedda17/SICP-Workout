# 1.8


# First Attempt
I start the exercise with establishing a procedure for improving the guess for the calculation of the cube root:

``` racket
(define (improve-cube-root x y) 
    (/ (+ (/ x (* y y)) (* 2 y)) 3))
``` 

So the iteration is given by this recursive procedure:

``` racket
(define (cube-root-iter guess x)
	(if (good-enough? guess x) guess 
	(cube-root-iter (improve-cube-root guess x) x)))
``` 
	
	I remember the good-enough? procedure that I used in the exercise for the sqrt one:

``` racket
	(define (good-enough? guess x) 
        (< (abs (- (improve-cube-root guess x) guess)) (+ 0.00001 guess)))
``` 

	
	Now that I deal with the cube-root procedure...
``` racket
	(define (good-enough? guess x) 
        (< (abs (- (improve-cube-root guess x) guess)) (+ 0.0000001 guess)))
```


I'm gonna give it a try...

START TEST---  
Negative

(cube-root-iter 1.0 8)    
Result 1.0, Wanted 2 approx  
(good-enough? 1.0 8)  
1.0  
(improve-cube-root 1.0 8)  
5 approx?

I mistook the role of y and x in a function, y is the result of the function so is the guess in the formula of the approximation of the cube root,
moreover, I did a wrong assumption for the tolerance established with good-enough? not following the proper mathematical consequences of an absulate value
Adjusting my procedures with these new corrections, it will look like:
``` racket
(define (improve-cube-root y x) (/ (+ (/ x (* y y)) (* 2 y)) 3))
(define (good-enough? guess x) (< (abs (- (improve-cube-root guess x) guess)) 0.00001 ))
```
