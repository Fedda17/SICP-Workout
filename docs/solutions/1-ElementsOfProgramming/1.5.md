# 1.5

I remember that in the applicative mode, all the values ​​of the elements in a combination are calculated first and then the operator applies the procedure, always starting from the innermost combination.
Following the procedure:
``` racket
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
 (if (= x 0)
 0
 y))
```

And calling it with (test 0 (p))
The expression first evaluates this combination starting with (p), but since the procedure p is defined by the procedure call of p the evaluation never stops.
Instead, by switching to normal-ordinative mode, the values in the procedure call ​​are calculated only when the operator in the combination to which they belong needs them, so the y in the if expression associated with y is never "considered" because the if expression assumes that only the predicate determines what to calculate.
