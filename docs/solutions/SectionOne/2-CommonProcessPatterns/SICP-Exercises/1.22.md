I need to use the  current-inexact-milliseconds in Scheme to test the algorithm efficiency of a procedure that search for prime numbers in a range
which will be mutually defined by these ones:

 ``` racket
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) 
         n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) 
         test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor 
               n 
               (+ test-divisor 1)))))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (current-inexact-milliseconds)))

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (report-prime (- (current-inexact-milliseconds) 
                       start-time)) (display " NO")))

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))
 ```

 
Pick a specific range and consider only odd numbers:

 ``` racket
(define (prime-range-test x y)
	(define (next-odd x)
		(if (even? x) (+ x 1) (+ x 2))
	)
	(cond ((> x y)
			(newline)
			(display "END"))
			(else (timed-prime-test x)
				  (prime-range-test (next-odd x) y)))
)
 ```

Does testing primes around 10000 takes sqrt(10) time longer than testing aroung 1000?
It does seems so by checking by calculator, but the time is not always the same at each iteration because of some noise
Now let's see how 10000 and 100000 compare
It seems consistent with the prediction because n increased by 10 times
Now for 100000 and 1000000
It stays consistent so the prediction that the steps required for the computations are proportional with
the size of the problem is true.
