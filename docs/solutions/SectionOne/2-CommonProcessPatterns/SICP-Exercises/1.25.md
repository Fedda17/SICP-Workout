This is the regular expmod defined in the book:

``` racket
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder 
          (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
          m))
        (else
         (remainder 
          (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))
```
This is the expmod that Alyssa wanted to see:
``` racket
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
  
  (define (fast-expt b n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 
         1)
        ((even? n) 
         (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (else 
         (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
```

At first glance, the task seems different since the second definition computes remainder only once

Let's test it with fast-prime:

``` racket
(define (fermat-test n)
  (define (try-it a)
    (= (expmod a n n) a))
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))
  
(define (fast-prime? n times)
  (cond ((= times 0) #t)
        ((fermat-test n) 
         (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
        (else #f)))
 ```		

The procedure works but I noticed that it takes a lot of time when i put 100000009 as argument, why is the case?

This requires a bit of investigation:

let's trace
The number becomes exponentially too big and it gets tacky to perform checking operations on it in the second definition.
Instead the first definition relies on decreasing the number by applying the remainder at each iteration and relying on the definition of GCD between two numbers.
