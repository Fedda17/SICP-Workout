The procedure modified by Louis generates a tree recursive process that generally computes in a 
exponential time. If exp is the size of the problem then even if the problem gets divided by two
when exp is even, the fact that performs the same calculation twice at each iteration it evens out 
the reduction by 2 at each iteraction since at each call we got 2 times the same call.
