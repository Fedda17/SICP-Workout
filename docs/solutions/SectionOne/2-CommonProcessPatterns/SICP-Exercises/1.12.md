I have to write a recursive procedure that solves the pascal problem using a recursive process...

let's say that the pascal triangle is modeled by a function that accepts an integer and returns a point of the pascal triangle


so the procedure can be summarized by a case analysis:

f(n) = 0 if row - n <= 1  
row =   
f(n) = 1 if n < 3 and n >= 0  
f(n) = f(n - x) + f(n - y) if n >= 3  


if f(4)= f(1) + f(2)

if f(7) = f(3) + f(4)

if f(11) = f(6) + f(7)

if f(12) = f(7) + f(8)

if f(13) = f(8) + f(9)
   

What are the values of x and y given a point n >= 3?

 I can see that the pascal triangle at (n-1)-th row it will have n points, this tells me how to determine where I am in the sequence. Or I can consider a procedure with two inputs: column and row.
 
 Then it becomes straightforward that
 
 f(c,r) = 0 if c, r < 1  
 f(c,r) = 1 if c = r and c = 1  
 f(c,r) = f(c - 1, r - 1) + f(c - 1, r) if c,r > 1  
 
 ``` racket
 (define (pascal-triangle c r)
    (cond ((or (= c r) (= c 1)) 1)
          ((or (< c 1) (< r 1)) 0)
          (else (+ (pascal-triangle (- c 1) (- r 1)) (pascal-triangle c (- r 1)))))
    )
```
	

It's interesting to consider the triangle procedure as well:

``` racket
(define (triangle n) 
	(cond ((< n 1) 0)
			((= n 1) 1)
			(else (+ n (triangle (- n 1)))))
)
```

where an input n will yield f((c+r)/2, n + 1)
