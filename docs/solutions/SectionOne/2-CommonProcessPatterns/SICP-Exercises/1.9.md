This exercise tells me to use the substitute model to see the type of process these procedures generate:

``` racket
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

``` racket
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```  
	  
If I call the first with for example (+ 2 1)

the resulting substitions will be:

(inc (+ 1 1))  
(inc (inc (+ 0 1)))  
(inc (inc 1)) -> 3  



If I call the second one with (+ 2 1)

The resulting substitions will be:

(+ 1 2)  
(+ 0 3) -> 3  

The first accumulates a chain, while the second has a firm shape, therefore I conclude that the first is recursive and the second is iterative
