This exercise asks me to compute moltiplication using a process that evolves in logarithmic time which is similar to fast-expt, so reporting what I built in the previous exercise:

``` racket
(define (fast-molt n m)
	(define (iter-molt base n m)
			(cond 
				((= m 0) base)
				((even? m) (iter-molt base (+ n n) (/ m 2)))
				(else (iter-molt (+ base n) n (- m 1))))
	)
(iter-molt 0 n m))
```

This solves exercise 1.18 as well
