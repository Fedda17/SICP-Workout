This exercise requires to build a procedure that computes exponentation in an iterative way, the book reports the recursive way as follows:

 ``` racket
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))

(define (fast-expt b n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 
         1)
        ((even? n) 
         (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (else 
         (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
 ```


The exercise says to use these two hints:

use a state variable a that saves the result of the moltiplication
and the observation that (b^n/2)^2=(b^2)^(n/2)

a at the start is 1

the rule for the evolution of the process can be:

a <- ab^k
k<- k/2 if even, else k - 1

 ``` racket
(define (fast-expt b n)
	(define (iter-expt a b k)
			(cond 
				((= k 0) a)
				((even? k) (iter-expt a (square b) (/ k 2)))
				(else (iter-expt (* a b) b (- k 1))))
	)
(iter-expt 1 b n))
 ```
