## Follow Up
This exercise requires to compute the n^th root of a number using repetitions of the average dumping procedure in order to make it converge, the problem arises that when I increase n I don't know how many 
applications of the average-dumping procedure the problem requires in order to get a number (that makes sense)

The text says that for fourth-roots I need to apply average dumping twice, so I'll start by testing this case and writing down the definitions I need:

``` racket
(define (compose f g) (lambda (x) (f (g x))))
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 0) (lambda (x) x) (compose f (repeated f (- n 1))))) 

(define average (lambda (x y) (/ (+ x y) 2)))

(define (average-damp f)
  (lambda (x) 
    (average x (f x))))
	
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) 
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
  
  (define (product term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      1
      (* (term a)
         (product term (next a) next b))))
  
```

## Stepping in
  now for the procedure that gives the 4th root of a number:

``` racket 
(define (4th-root x) (
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y)))))
			1.0
		)
	)
)
```

This doesn't work, because there are some extra parenthesis that tried to apply a procedure
``` racket
(define (4th-root x)
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y)))))
			1.0
		)
)
```
This is a rough sketch of a more defined procedure, so I'll try with the 5th root and 6th root as well to see where I need to apply more average-damping...

``` racket
(define (5th-root x)
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y y)))))
			1.0
		)
)

(define (6th-root x)
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y y y)))))
			1.0
		)
)
```

Assured that applying average damping twice work till 6th root, I'll try 7th and 8th too as well

``` racket

(define (7th-root x)
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y y y y)))))
			1.0
		)
)


(define (9th-root x)
		(fixed-point 
			(average-damp (average-damp (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (* y y y y y y y y))))))
			1.0
		)
)
``` 

## Pattern 
Still work with 7th root but doesn't wotk with 8th root, so to sum it up:

average damping once enough for 2,3 th  root
average damping twice enough for 4,5,6,7 th root

Is the formula (N-Of-Average-Damping * 4) -  n-of-roots > 0 enough for making a procedure that computes the n-th root of a number?

I'll test more rapidly for the 8,9,10,11,12 th roots using the repeated procedure if this works:

``` racket
(define (8-9-10-11-12th-root n x)
	(fixed-point 
		(repeated 
			(average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (product 
													(lambda (i) y) 
													1 
													(lambda (i) (+ i 1))
													(- n 1)
												)
										)
							)
			)
		3) 
	1.0) 
)
```

## Pivot
I used a pattern for the fixed point function of the nth root which it says that the denominator is y^n-1, but the theory remains that the average-damp procedure must be applied thrice for the values


Formula for knowing the number of repetition of the average-damping:


(+ (floor (/ n 4) ) 1)


So the n-th root procedure is:

``` racket
(define (nth-root x n) 
		(fixed-point 
			((repeated average-damp (+ (floor (/ n 4)) 1)) (lambda (y) (/ x (product 
													(lambda (i) y) 
													1 
													(lambda (i) (+ i 1))
													(- n 1)
												))))
			1.0
		)
	
)
```
