# 1.33

## Follow up
This exercise still tells me to create another higher order procedure that abstracts the condition of the final recursion in operations like summation and product of a series
I recall the definition of accumulation:

``` racket
(define (accumulate null-value combiner term a next b)
	(if (> a b) 
		null-value 
		(combiner (term a) (accumulate null-value combiner term (next a) next b))))
```

## Pivot
I transform the predicate of the definition as a formal parameter and I call it filter:

``` racket
(define (filtered-accumulate filter null-value combiner term a next b)
	(if (filter a b)
		null-value 
		(combiner (term a) (filtered-accumulate filter null-value combiner term (next a) next b))))
```

--- Test POSITIVE
After adjusting some lexical errors this procedure does what the exercise required.
Not, to make a procedure that sums the square of the prime numbers between a and b, I have to come up with
a procedure that says when a number is prime, this is in an exercise in 1.2 chapter of the book so I'll pass for now
