## Follow up
I must build a procedure that computes the integral of a number between a and b using the Simpson's Rule
the exercise tells me that h = (b - a), without using the symbol let, I define this variable internally, and starting
to compose the procedure as defined:

``` racket
(define (integral-simpson-rule f a b n)
	(define h (/ (- b a) n))
	)
```

Since the integral is a summation of specific values that the function returns in terms, I reuse the sum procedure that the book provides...

``` racket
(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))
```

Now I must define what is term and what is next...

## Pivot
the exercise tells me that yk = f(a + kh), so I must apply the f to the arguments a + kh
k is the progression of the series so it's "next" and it's basically the next integer till "n"
the progression also has a product and it alternates based if k is even or odd with the exception of 0 and n
So putting all this together...

``` racket
(define (integral-simpson-rule f a b n)
	(define h (/ (- b a) n))
	(if (odd? n) (- 1)
	(* (/ h 3) (sum (lambda (k) (* (cond ((or (= k 0) (= k n)) 1)
											((even? k) 2)
											(odd? 4)) (f (+ a (* k h))))) 
					0
					(lambda (k) (+ k 1))
					n))))
```
