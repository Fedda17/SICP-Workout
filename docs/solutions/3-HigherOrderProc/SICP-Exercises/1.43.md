# 1.43


## Follow Up
Exercise 1.43 requires to write a higher order procedure that returns a procedure which is a composition of a procedure applied n times


## Attempts
``` racket
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 1) (lambda (x) x) (repeated (lambda (x) (f (f x))) (- n 1)))) 
```

This procedure doesn't work because it doesn't apply the accumulted composition at the end.
``` racket
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 0) (lambda (x) (f x)) (repeated (lambda (x) (f (f x))) (- n 1)))) 
```

this doesn't work because it doubles the number of applications at each iteration.

## Solution

``` racket
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 1) (lambda (x) (f x)) (repeated (lambda (x) (f (f x))) (- n 1)))) 
```

This does exactly what the exercise wants, it's natural that when n = 1 the function is applied only once.
The exercise suggests to use the compose function but I used directly the lambda value of that function, but if I want to make the intention more clear:

``` racket
(define (compose f g) (lambda (x) (f (g x))))
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 1) (lambda (x) (f x)) (repeated (compose f f) (- n 1)))) 
```

And this exercise is cleared.
