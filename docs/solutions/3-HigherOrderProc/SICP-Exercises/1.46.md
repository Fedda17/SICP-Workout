## Follow Up
This last exercise for this section wants to have a general method for methods that require an improvements over some values called
iterative improvement.
The domain of this procedure are two procedures: a function to improve the guess and a function that is a predicate which says whether the value is good
The range is a procedure that takes the guess as an argument and improve the guess until it's good enough based on the function we pass as an argument


I have to test this new formulation with the sqrt procedure of section 1 and the fixed-point procedure, so I'll rewrite them here:

``` racket
(define (sqrt x)
  (define (good-enough? guess x)
    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (define (improve guess x)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    (if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
  
  
  (define tolerance 0.00001)
  
  (define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) 
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
```
  

## Pivot
  
``` racket
  (define (iterative-improve improve good-enough?) 
		(define (iter-improve-guess guess) 
			(let ((next (improve guess))) 
				(if (good-enough? guess next) 
					next 
					(iter-improve-guess next)))
		) 
	iter-improve-guess)
	
	(define (sqrt x) 
		((iterative-improve 
			(lambda (guess) (average guess (/ x guess)))
			(lambda (v1 v2) (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))) 1.0)
	)
	
	
	(define (fixed-point f) 
		((iterative-improve 
			(lambda (guess) (f guess))
			(lambda (v1 v2) (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))) 1.0))
```
