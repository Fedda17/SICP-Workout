# 1.34

If I have (define (f g) (g 2))
And try to call it with (f f)?

A quick test gives:
application: not a procedure;
 expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  given: 2
  
Following the substitution model I think it'll give a clear answer to the problem...

(f f) <- call

(f 2)<- application and call itself again

and it becomes (2 2), if I write this combination in Scheme, I obtain the same error, indeed the symbol 2 is not a procedure.
