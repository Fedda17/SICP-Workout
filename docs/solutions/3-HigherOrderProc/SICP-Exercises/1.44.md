# 1.44


## Follow up
This exercise requires to make a procedure that embeds the concept of "smoothing" a function, the domain and the range of this procedure are both a function, this function is a precise defined math one

First attempt to conjure it:

``` racket
(define dx 0.000001)
(define (smooth f) 	(lambda (x) (/ (+ (f x) (f (+ x dx)) (f (- x dx)) ) 3)))
```

The exercise requires to combine the n-repetition application of the smoothing, called n-fold smoothed function

I made this in exercise 1.43:

``` racket
(define (compose f g) (lambda (x) (f (g x))))
(define (repeated f n)	(if (= n 1) (lambda (x) (f x)) (repeated (compose f f) (- n 1)))) 
```

the n-fold smoothed function then is defined as follow:

``` racket
(define (n-fold-smooth n f)
	(define (smooth f) 	(lambda (x) (/ (+ (f x) (f (+ x dx)) (f (- x dx)) ) 3)))
	(repeated smooth n))
```

	The value of this procedure is not what I expected: this expression ((n-fold-smooth 2 square) 5) returns yet another procedure.
	
## Pivot
	Alright, I got the problem, the call missed the application of a procedure to the smooth function, so the right definition is:
	
    ``` racket
	(define (n-fold-smooth n f)
	(define (smooth f) 	(lambda (x) (/ (+ (f x) (f (+ x dx)) (f (- x dx)) ) 3)))
	(repeated (smooth f) n))
	```


## Further considerations...
	Yeah, this definition is a bit messy because it reuses the same names but hopefully the syntax is clear enough that you can see when it's an application or a definition.
	What's curious about the precedent formulation is that the interpreter with an expression like this (((n-fold-smooth 2 square) 5) 5) applied the last combination as an argument to the smooth function, next time I hope to gain some perspective on this.
