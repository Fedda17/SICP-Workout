## Product procedure part I
I have to conjure a procedure that defines the concept of product of a series, I think that it can't be vastly different from the definition of sum
so I re-use the higher order procedure of sum...
``` racket
(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))
```
The multiplicative identity is 1 instead of 0 and the operation is * instead of +, so I change it with the new name as well...

``` racket
(define (product term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      1
      (* (term a)
         (product term (next a) next b))))
```

## Product procedure part II
Now I test the procedure by performing a multiplication from 1 to 10, so a factorial of 10, the result should be 3.628.800
``` racket
(product (lambda (x) x) 1 (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 10)
```

Positive test, but I think if I put a = 0 the factorial doesn't work, so I must change the term procedure in such a way:
if x = 0 -> 1 
This is the complete application:
``` racket
(product (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) 1 x)) 0 (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 10)
```
So to define factorial I use this definition:
``` racket
(define (factorial n) 
	(product (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) 1 x)) 0 (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) n))
```

## John Wallis procedure part I
The exercise requires also the procedure that computes the approximations to pi following the John Wallis way.

``` racket
(define (john-wallis-pi n)
(* 4.0 (/ (product (lambda (k) ((cond ((= k 0) 1)
							((odd? k) (+ k 2))
							(else (+ k 1))))) 1 (lambda (k) (+ k 1)) n) (product (lambda (k) (cond ((= k 1) 2)
																	((even? k) (+ k 2))
																	(else (+ k 1)))) 1 (lambda (k) (+ k 1)) n))))
```
This is kinda convoluted, so once I'll test it, I'll change the lambda for the terms into internal definitions, I'll also add a case where if x < 0 then it returns -1, but for now...
--- Test Negative  
This procedure doesn't work because k affects how the series progresses without accounting for the position

## John Wallis procedure part II
``` racket
(define (john-wallis-pi n)
	(define (next-numerator k) (+ k (cond ((= k 0) 1)
								((even? k) 2)
								(else 1))))
	(define (next-denominator k) (+ k (cond ((= k 1) 2)
										((odd? k) 2)
										(else 1))))
	(if (< x 0) -1 (* 4.0 (/ (product next-numerator  1 (lambda (k) (+ k 1)) n) (product next-denominator 1 (lambda (k) (+ k 1)) n)))))
	```
I made a trick here when taking the consideration that both the numerator and the denominator follow a certain pattern, that is, numerator is always increasingly even and denominator is always increasingly odd, I take the position of k in the series and add what's remaining to obtain the next in the series.
