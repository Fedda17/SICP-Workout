# Welcome to this humble documentation

Here's the documentation of the markdown I'm using for this website: [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Scope of this documentation

Here I'm presenting my thought processes regarding the exercises for this book I'm studying called Structure and Interpretation of Programs by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman, in this homepage you will find a quick summary of the resolutions of the exercises with a link to the source code and the page that demonstrates how I arrived at the conclusion including wrong assumptions, basically the whole trial and error stuff. Why did I included my whole reasoning? I noticed that It's easier to me following a logic line if I tentavily write any thought that occurs to me, if I just think about it without any tool for grasping the thought I can easily "lose my mind" that is, I jump a lot with different thoughts without knowing till the end which is the correct path, this is my determination. Also it can be fun.

## Important notes
The source code is only compilable with the IDE DrRacket and their extension will be a rkt file indeed which are not readable with a normal code editor unfortunately, I thank every person from the bottom of my heart who takes time to see how I'm doing with my studying.

Here's the host of the book which I'm studying from: [sarabander.github.io/sicp](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml)

In addition to the SICP exercises I'm also doing a course provided by Barkeley university for free! Check it out [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/Volume1/CS%2061A%20Course%20Reader,%20Volume%201.html)

## Summaries...
Presenting to you the threading I did in order to make sense of the exercises in a portable way
